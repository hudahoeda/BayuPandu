# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The BayuPandu firmware is the core software system for an open-source, FAI-compliant paragliding flight computer built on ESP32. The firmware must provide professional-grade flight instrumentation including high-precision variometer functionality, GPS tracking with IGC logging, comprehensive sensor data processing, and a sunlight-readable display interface. The system is designed for cost-effective DIY construction while maintaining competition-grade performance and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

2. WHEN running unit tests THEN the HAL SHALL support simulated implementations for testing without physical hardware
3. WHEN a hardware component fails THEN the HAL SHALL provide consistent error reporting across all components
4. IF a sensor is unavailable THEN the HAL SHALL gracefully degrade functionality without system crashes

### Requirement 2: Barometric Pressure and Variometer System

**User Story:** As a paraglider pilot, I want accurate vertical speed readings, so that I can detect thermals and navigate effectively during flight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the barometric sensor reads pressure THEN the system SHALL calculate altitude with 10cm resolution
2. WHEN altitude changes THEN the system SHALL compute vertical speed with Kalman filtering for smooth readings
3. WHEN vertical speed exceeds configurable thresholds THEN the system SHALL generate audio tones via piezo buzzer
4. WHEN the sensor fails THEN the system SHALL display error status and continue operating other functions
5. IF pressure readings are unstable THEN the system SHALL apply noise filtering algorithms

### Requirement 3: GPS Navigation and Flight Logging

**User Story:** As a competitive pilot, I want FAI-compliant flight logging, so that my flights can be validated for competitions and records.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GPS acquires satellite lock THEN the system SHALL display current position, speed, and heading
2. WHEN in flight mode THEN the system SHALL log GPS data in IGC format to microSD card
3. WHEN flight is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically start logging without user intervention
4. WHEN flight ends THEN the system SHALL finalize and close the IGC file properly
5. IF GPS signal is lost THEN the system SHALL continue logging with dead reckoning estimates
6. WHEN storage is full THEN the system SHALL alert user and manage file rotation
7. WHEN flight is detected THEN the system SHALL output sound and visualizations for flight start and end events

### Requirement 4: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) Integration

**User Story:** As a pilot, I want attitude and heading information, so that I can maintain proper flight orientation and navigation awareness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the IMU initializes THEN the system SHALL calibrate accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer
2. WHEN in flight THEN the system SHALL provide real-time attitude data (pitch, roll, yaw)
3. WHEN GPS heading is unavailable THEN the system SHALL use magnetometer for compass heading
4. WHEN detecting rapid attitude changes THEN the system SHALL filter out vibration noise
5. IF IMU calibration fails THEN the system SHALL prompt user for recalibration procedure

### Requirement 5: Display and User Interface

**User Story:** As a pilot, I want clear flight information display, so that I can read critical data in bright sunlight conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN the display SHALL show startup sequence and system status
2. WHEN in flight mode THEN the display SHALL show altitude, vertical speed, GPS data, and battery status
3. WHEN in sunlight THEN the display SHALL remain readable using transflective LCD or e-paper technology
4. WHEN user presses buttons THEN the system SHALL navigate through different display screens
5. IF display fails THEN the system SHALL continue audio feedback and data logging
6. WHEN battery is low THEN the display SHALL show prominent battery warning
7. The UI SHALL be implemented using the LVGL (Light and Versatile Graphics Library) framework to ensure a modern, responsive, and maintainable interface.

### Requirement 6: Data Storage and Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want reliable data storage and configurable settings, so that I can customize the device and preserve flight data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system starts THEN configuration SHALL be loaded from JSON files on microSD card
2. WHEN user changes settings THEN the system SHALL save configuration persistently
3. WHEN logging flights THEN data SHALL be written to microSD with error checking
4. WHEN storage errors occur THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and alert the user
5. IF microSD card is removed THEN the system SHALL continue operating with reduced functionality

### Requirement 7: Power Management and Battery Monitoring

**User Story:** As a pilot, I want long battery life and power awareness, so that the device doesn't fail during critical flight operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN battery voltage drops below warning threshold THEN the system SHALL display low battery alert
2. WHEN battery is critically low THEN the system SHALL enter power saving mode
3. WHEN charging THEN the system SHALL display charging status and allow continued operation
4. WHEN in power saving mode THEN the system SHALL reduce display brightness and sensor polling rates
5. IF power fails suddenly THEN the system SHALL safely close open files before shutdown

### Requirement 8: Audio Feedback System

**User Story:** As a pilot, I want audio variometer tones, so that I can focus on flying while receiving lift/sink information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN climbing THEN the system SHALL generate rising tone frequency proportional to climb rate
2. WHEN sinking THEN the system SHALL generate descending tone frequency proportional to sink rate
3. WHEN in weak lift THEN the system SHALL provide subtle audio cues without being distracting
